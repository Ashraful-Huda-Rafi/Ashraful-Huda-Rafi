As a penetration tester, I simulate real-world attacks to identify weaknesses in networks and systems. To identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited, I must think like a threat actor. I assist enterprises in fortifying their defenses by evaluating and testing security methods. It's a methodical and proactive way to keep ahead of online dangers.
