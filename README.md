As an ethical hacker, I imitate actual attacks to find weaknesses in networks and systems. In order to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited, I have to think like a threat actor. I assist enterprises in fortifying their defenses by evaluating and testing security methods. It's a methodical and proactive way to keep ahead of online dangers.
